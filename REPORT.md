- The user notes that the confirmation page layout is slightly confusing

**Second Test:**
- User notes the blue continue button is placed awkwardly on shipping and billing page
- User notes the blue checkmark when adding to cart is too big
- User got confused when going to the billing page because it looks very similar to the shipping page and thought they did something wrong
- Information from shipping did not carry over properly to billing and had trouble finding the problem

**Third Test:**

## Second Round of Testing

**First Test:**
